        <p class="bio">David Wu was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1992. He spent his youth developing his passion for music through his studies of piano and violin, as well as becoming involved in community music groups such as the Crystal Children's Choir and the California Youth Symphony. David was also dedicated to his studies in math and the physical sciences, and was accepted into the UC Irvine physics program upon graduating from high school in 2010. </p>
        <p class="bio">David became a math and science teacher at Fusion Academy, Mission Viejo shortly after completing his Bachelor's degree at UC Irvine in 2015. For four years, he worked with high school students that had a variety of learning disabilities or Individualized Education Programs in a one-on-one environment. After four years of teaching high school physics, Algebra, statistics, and calculus, he went on to study web development with UCI's Division of Continuing Education. </p>
        <p class="bio">David's passion for music, math, and learning has only ever grown with age; he currently devotes his time to learning how to code web pages, and hopes to continue honing his skills as a web developer in the upcoming years.</p>
